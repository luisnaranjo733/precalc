<p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>
<p>This artifact demonstrates how to make conic models that fit given conditions.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m assuming that the center of this ellipse is (0, 0).</p>
<p>I know b^2 = 4 because the problem tells us what the minor axis length is.</p>
<p>Since the foci are 6 y-units apart, the point between them would be on y = 3, so c = 3.</p>
<p>Knowing <span class="math">\(b^2\)</span> and c, I can solve for <span class="math">\(a^2\)</span> using the pythagorean relation for ellipses <span class="math">\(a^2 = b^2 + c^2\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Artifact</strong>:</p>
<p>Find an equation of the ellipse with foci <span class="math">\((0, \pm3)\)</span> whose minor axis has length 4.</p>

<h2>How to graph conic sections from equations<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-graph-conic-sections-from-equations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Source</strong>: Group Quiz 8.2 &amp; 8.3</p>
<p><strong>Group Work</strong></p>
<p>This problem was from a group quiz. We initially did this problem independently, but we got different answers, so we worked together to figure out which one was correct.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed from the equation was that it had addition, so it had to be ellipsoidal.</p>
<p>I noticed that the value with the highest denominator had <span class="math">\(y^2\)</span> in the numerator, so I knew it was an ellipse opening vertically.</p>
<p>This also told me that <span class="math">\(a^2 = 25 \text{ , } b^2 = 9\)</span>, and that I could rely on the formula <span class="math">\({(y-k)^2 \over a^2} + {(x-h)^2 \over b^2} = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>I knew the center was <span class="math">\((-2 ,-5)\)</span> by comparing equation with the formula.</p>
<p>I knew that the pythagorean relation for an ellipsoid is <span class="math">\(c^2 = a^2 - b^2\)</span>, so I used my a and b values solve for the distance from the center to the foci (4)</p>
<p>I knew my foci had to be at <span class="math">\((h, k\pm c) = (-2, -3\pm 4)\)</span>.</p>
<p>I also knew that my end point had to be at <span class="math">\((h\pm b, k) = (-2\pm 3, -3)\)</span> because <span class="math">\(b = \sqrt{b^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3\)</span>.</p>
<p>From there, all I had to do was graph.</p>

<h2>The applications of conic sections<a class="headerlink" href="#the-applications-of-conic-sections" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Source</strong>: Section 8.1 Example 6/my own little twist</p>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>
<p>This artifact demonstrates the applications of conic sections.</p>
<p>This artifact demonstrates how to graph conic sections from equations.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, I went off the assumption that the vertex of the parabolic reflector was at (0,0).</p>
<p>This assumption allowed me to use the formula <span class="math">\(x^2 = 4py\)</span></p>
<p>Since the vertex was at (0,0), the distance accross the reflector (6 feet) must divided symmetrically by the y-axis.</p>
<p>Since parabolas are always perfectly symmetric, the distance from the center to the endpoints of the parabolic reflector must be <span class="math">\(1 \over 2\)</span> of the distance of the width of the parabolic reflector.</p>
<p>I also knew from the problem that the vertical distance from the center is 2.</p>
<p>Knowing these things, I was able to deduce that the endpoints of the parabolic reflector had to be at <span class="math">\((\pm3,2)\)</span>.</p>
<p>With that coordinate, all I had to do was plug into the parabolic formula, and solve for p (because p is the distance from the center to the foci).</p>
<p><strong>Artifact</strong>:</p>
<p>At his weekend job as a secret agent in the CIA, Luis uses a parabolic reflector that he wears on his head with a microphone at the reflector&#8217;s focus to capture the conversations of russian spies.</p>
<p>If the parabolic reflector is 6 feet across and 2 feet deep, where should the microphone be placed?</p>
<p>Center = <span class="math">\((0, 0)\)</span></p>
<div class="math">
\[(\pm3)^2 = 4p(2)\]\[p = {9 \over 8}\]</div>
<p>The microphone should be placed <span class="math">\(\approx 1.125\)</span> feet from the vertex of the parabolic reflector.</p>

<h2>How to algebraically manipulate conic equations into standard form<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-algebraically-manipulate-conic-equations-into-standard-form" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Source</strong>: Group Quiz 8.2 &amp; 8.3</p>
<p><strong>Group Work</strong></p>
<p>This problem was from a group quiz. The three of us worked on this problem together.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>
<p>This artifact demonstrates how to algebraically manipulate conic equations into standard form.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was organizational. I put the x values next to the other x values and the y values next to the other y values.</p>
<p>Then I pulled a common factor from the x&#8217;s (25) and a common factor from the y&#8217;s (16).</p>
<p>The result of this was two quadratic equations which I then factored using completing the square.</p>
<p>Once I had completed the square, I divided both sides by 400 to make the equation equal to 1 (because I knew it is a conic).</p>
<p>Then I divided the remaining common factors (25 and 16) by both sides to complete the hyperbolic equation.</p>
<p><strong>Artifact</strong>:</p>
<p>Use completing the square and find the equation for <span class="math">\(25y^2 - 16x^2 - 100y - 224x - 1084 = 0\)</span></p>
<div class="math">
\[25y^2 - 100y - 16x - 224x = 1084\]\[25(y^2 - 4y + 4) - 15(x^2 + 14x + 49) = 1084 + 100 - 784\]\[25(y - 2)^2 - 16(x + 7)^2 = 400\]\[{25(y - 2)^2 \over 400} - {16(x + 7)^2 \over 400} = {400 \over 400}\]\[{(y-2)^2 \over 16} - {(x+7)^2 \over 25} = 1\]</div>

<h2>Parabolas, ellipses and hyperbolas<a class="headerlink" href="#parabolas-ellipses-and-hyperbolas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Source</strong>: Group Quiz 8.2 &amp; 8.3</p>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>
<p>This artifact demonstrates parabolas, ellipses and hyperbolas.</p>
<p>The transverse axis is <span class="math">\(2a \text{, so } 2a = 6\)</span>.</p>
<p>The distance between the center and the foci (c) is the same as the distance between the two foci (in the x) divided by 2, which is 4.</p>
<p>I used the pythagorean relation for a hyperbola, which is <span class="math">\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\)</span>, to solve for <span class="math">\(b^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>I took half the distance between the two foci to get the x value of my center (-1).</p>
<p>I knew the y value of my center was 4, because the center is on the same level as the two given foci.</p>
<p>Now I could just plug into the hyperbolic formula to get the standard form of this hyperbola.</p>
<p><span class="math">\({(x-h)^2 \over a^2} - {(y-k)^2 \over b^2} = 1\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Artifact</strong>:</p>
