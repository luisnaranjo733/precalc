Function composition and inherited domain and range
---------------------------------------------------

**Source**: I made this problem up

**Explanation**:

This artifact demonstrates function composition and inherited domain and range.

I present two different funtions, and I give their individual domain and range.

Then, I compose them (:math:`(f \circ g)(x)`), and show the inherited domain and range of the new function.

The domain of :math:`(f \circ g)(x)` is usually the domain of :math:`f(x)` and the range of :math:`g(x)`,

but in this case, it is only the positive portion because :math:`(f \circ g)(x)` has a radical, and the domain of any radical is :math:`x \geq 0`

**Independent Thinking**:

This artifact also demonstrates independent thinking because its' source code uses quite a few LaTeX expressions that I didn't know how to use at the time.

I went through the source code of another LaTeX document I found online and figured out how to use latex expressions in my code.

**Artifact**:

Find :math:`(f \circ g)(x)`

.. math::

   f(x) = \sqrt{x}
   
   \text{Domain: } [0, \infty)
   
   \text{Range: } [0, \infty)
   
   g(x) = {1 \over (x-1)}
   
   \text{Domain: } (-\infty, 1), (1, \infty)

   \text{Range: } (-\infty, 0), (0, \infty)

   (f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))

   f({1 \over (x-1)}) = \sqrt{{1 \over (x-1)}}

   \text{Domain: }(1, \infty)

   \text{Range: }(0, \infty)

Function decomposition
----------------------

**Source**: I made this problem up.

**Explanation**: How does this artifact meet the objectives and goals?

In this artifact I demonstrate how a function can be decomposed into two different functions.

**Awareness and appreciation**:

There is potentially an infinite amount of solutions to this problem, but this is probably the best solution for two reasons.

* It is the simplest solution
* Because it is the simplest solution, it is also the easiest to re-compose into the original function.

**Artifact**:

Decompose :math:`(f \circ g)(x)`

.. math::

   (f \circ g)(x) = \sqrt{x^2 + 3}
   
   \text{find } f(x) \text{and} g(x)

   f(x) = \sqrt{x}

   g(x) = x^2 + 3

Parametric functions and how they relate to function composition
----------------------------------------------------------------

**Source**: Question #4 from 1.5

**Explanation**: How does this artifact meet the objectives and goals?

The first example demonstrates: How to find an (x, y) pair when given a parametric function and a t value.

The second example demonstrates: How a linear function can be composed from a parametric function.

**Artifact**:

Find the (x,y) pair for the value of the parameter

:math:`x = t + 3` and :math:`y = {1 \over t}` for :math:`t = -8`:

.. math::

   (x, y)

   x = t + 3

   x = -8 + 3

   x = 5

   y = {1 \over t}

   y = {1 \over -8}

   (5, -{1 \over 8})

Eliminate the parameter:

.. math::

   t = x - 3 \text{ in terms of x}

   y = {1 \over (x - 3)}

Inverse functions and inherited domain and range
------------------------------------------------

**Source**: Section 1.5: Example 4

**Explanation**: How does this artifact meet the objectives and goals?

This artifact demonstrates inverse functions and inherited domain and range.

I present a regular function, and I show its' domain and range.

Then I invert it, and show that the domain and range of the result is the inverse of the original function.

**Appropriate Use of Technology**

I used an online graphing calculator to generate the graph below.

Once I generated it:

* I took a screenshot of the online graph
* I cropped the screenshot
* I added the image to my local code repository
* I included the image in my source code
* I uploaded it the image my code repository (github)
* I synchronized my readthedocs.org project with my github repository

**Numeric Algebraic Graphic Connection** (N.A.G.)

I used a graph to show the N.A.G. connection between the original function and the inverse function.

The red one is the original function, and the yellow one is the inverse function.

**Artifact**:

Find an equation for :math:`f^-1 (x)` if :math:`f(x) = {x \over (x+1)}`.

Domain: :math:`(-\infty, -1), (-1, \infty)`

Range: :math:`(-\infty, 1), (1, \infty)`

.. math::

   x = {y \over (y+1)}

   x(y + 1) = y

   xy + x = y

   xy - y = -x

   y(x - 1) = -x

   y = {-x \over (x-1)}

   y = {x \over (1-x)}

   f^-1 (x) = {x \over (1-x)}

   \text{The domain and range are flipped because x and y were flipped.}

   \text{Domain: }(-\infty, 1), (1, \infty)

   \text{Range: }(-\infty, -1), (-1, \infty)
