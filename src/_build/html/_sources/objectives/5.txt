Graphs of rational functions including all intercepts and asymptotes
--------------------------------------------------------------------

**Source**: I remembered the reciprocal function from the 12 basic functions, so I got it from there.

**Explanation**: 

This artifact demonstrates graphs of rational functions including all intercepts and asymptotes.

There is an asymptote at :math:`x = 0` because if x were ever 0 the function would be undefined (you can't divide by zero).

There is an asymptote at :math:`y = 0` because the numerator is 1. One slice of the pie is larger than 0 slices of the pie.

There is no x-intercept and there is no y-intercept because of the asymptotes (y = 0, and x = 0).

**Artifact**:

:math:`\text{Graph of }f(x) = {1 \over x}`

Algebraic manipulation of rational functions
--------------------------------------------

**Source**: Notes

**Explanation**: 

This artifact demonstrates algebraic manipulation of rational functions.

Here I demonstrate that I find rational zeroes by manipulating a rational function into linear factors.

**Artifact**:

Find all of the rational zeroes for :math:`t(x) = 3x^3 + 4x^2 - 5x -2`

Using the rational zero theorem: :math:`\pm1, \pm2 \over \pm1, \pm3`

Synthetic Division (:math:`{3x^3 + 4x^2 - 5x -2 \over (x-1)}`)

==== ==== ==== ====
3    4    -5   -2
==== ==== ==== ====
0    3    7    2
3    7    2    0
==== ==== ==== ====

:math:`(x-1)(3x^2 + 7x + 2)`

:math:`(x-1)(3x + 1) (x+2)`

Utilizing rational functions through applications
-------------------------------------------------

**Source**: Online

**Application**:

I don't think that this formula is reliable, but it is still a good example of how rational functions might be applied in our day to day life.

This type of formula may have been useful to me a few months ago, when I was trying to find out how much having wi-fi on affected my phone's battery life.

A few months ago I went on the Junior Retreat. We did a lot of gardening. I worked on planting new plants, which was a repetitive process.

I counted the time it took my to plant a new plant (I can't remember what the time exactly).

But I remember being curious how long it would take me if I had a friend help me. A rational function like this may have helped me figure this out.

**Explanation**: 

This artifact demonstrates utilizing rational functions through applications.

**Artifact**:

T=(AB)/(A+B), gives the time T, it takes for two workers to complete a particular task.

A+B represents the time it would take for each individual worker to complete the identical task. 

It takes Joe 2 hours to weed the garden, and it takes Joe's older brother twice as long.

Estimate how long it would take for the two of them to complete the task together.

A = 2, B = 4

:math:`T = {2 * 4 \over 2 + 4}\\
T = {8 \over 6} = {4 \over 3} = 1 {1 \over 3} = \text{ 1 hour and 20 minutes}`




Solving rational functions inequalities
---------------------------------------

**Source**: I don't know.

**Explanation**: 

This artifact demonstrates solving rational functions inequalities.

The first thing I did was simplify the rational function.

Then I set up a sign chart with divisions at the zeroes, because those are the places where the sign of the graph could potentially change.

It was really only a matter of plugging in values in between the zeroes and recording them.


**Artifact**:

:math:`{x^2 -9 \over x^2 -1} < 0`

:math:`{x^2 -9 \over x^2 -1} == {(x-3) (x+3) \over (x-1)(x+1)}`

:math:`{x^2 -9 \over x^2 -1} < 0 \text{ when } -3 < x < -1 \text{ or } 1 < x < 3`
